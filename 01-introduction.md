# 1. Introduction

This article examines an approach to automating custom software development using a combination of **deterministic** and **non-deterministic** systems.

## Definitions

**Deterministic systems** are traditional scripts and process orchestration tools that guarantee repeatability and task completion. They follow predictable patterns and produce consistent results.

**Non-deterministic systems** refer to LLM-based code generation tools such as Codex and Claude Code, which provide creativity and generate novel code solutions. Their outputs can vary based on context and have inherent randomness.

## The Goal

The material in this article focuses on how to connect these approaches to:

- **Reduce manual labor** in software development
- **Decrease Effort-to-Market (ETM)** â€” the time, effort, and cost required to implement changes
- **Maintain quality control** throughout the development process

By combining the reliability of deterministic orchestration with the creative power of LLMs, we can build a system that scales development efficiency while keeping quality standards high.
