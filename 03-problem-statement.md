# 3. Problem Statement

Currently, LLMs have learned to create prototypes of applications (Replit, Lovable, Codex Web). However, I'm not yet aware of full-fledged use of LLMs in the long-term, repeatable cycle of application development and maintenance.

## The Challenge

Develop a system where efficiency will be higher than with the classical approach to software development. That is, Effort-to-Market will be lower with the same quality.

## Key Issues to Address

1. **Development as repeatable cycles** — cycles that need to be reliably completed and controlled
2. **LLM generates large volumes of code** — manual verification scales poorly and leads to oversights
3. **LLM corrections "on the fly" fail approximately 50% of the time**
4. **Need for a process where:**
   - Deterministic logic ensures repeatability and completion
   - Creativity is localized
   - Manual control is minimal and focused
   - Tasks are formulated to achieve results in one pass

The core problem is how to harness the creative power of LLMs while maintaining the control and repeatability necessary for production software development.
