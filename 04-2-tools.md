# 4.2 Tools and Recommendations

## Available Tools

### Cloud Code (~$100/month/person)

- Uses Opus/Sonnet models
- Does not have million-token context
- **Economically questionable for 2â€“3 people**

### Codex (~$40/month)

- Based on ChatGPT-5
- Encounters limits for several days at a time

### Cursor

- Expensive (approximately **$1500 total with active use**)
- Full-featured IDE integration

## Recommendation

**Use:** VS Code + Codex and Cloud Code plugins

**Avoid:** Cursor (due to cost)

This setup provides:
- Cost-effective solution
- Access to multiple LLM backends
- Flexibility in tool choice
- Ability to script and automate workflows

The combination of VS Code with plugins allows you to leverage the best of both worlds: a familiar development environment with powerful LLM assistance, all while keeping costs manageable for small teams.
