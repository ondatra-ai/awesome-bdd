# 6. Conclusion

The combination of deterministic orchestration and targeted creative LLM insertions provides control without loss of novelty.

## Key Insights

### "One Pass" is Achieved Through Preparation, Not Pressure

Success comes not from pressuring the model, but from rigorous preparation:

- **E2E tests** as a fixed goal
- **Prompt templates** as an interface
- **Scripts** as a source of reproducibility

### Review Translates to Continuous Improvement

Review is shifted from correcting results to improving task formulation for the next cycle. Each iteration makes the system better at succeeding on the first try.

### Objective Quality Measurement

In the end:
- **Percentage of requirements compliance increases**
- **Effort-to-Market (ETM) decreases**
- **Code quality is assessed objectively** through these two axes

### Scalability

This process scales with growing code volumes and maintains control where it truly matters â€” at the level of user scenarios and the effort required to respond to changes.

## The Core Value Proposition

By treating LLMs as creative tools within a deterministic framework, rather than as autonomous agents, we achieve:

1. **Predictable outcomes** through controlled processes
2. **Reduced manual effort** through automation
3. **Maintained quality** through objective testing
4. **Continuous improvement** through systematic review
5. **Scalable development** that doesn't break down as complexity grows

This approach transforms LLM-assisted development from an experimental prototype tool into a production-ready system for sustainable software development.
